This is a continuation of the code written by Sean Ballew.  The reason this has been forked is because his code is severl years old, is in the middle of 1.1 SNAPSHOT and I would like to complete this to get my CLI working.

I looked at Beanshell and Clamshell, but they seemed a bit too structurally invasice from a complexity or deployment POV.

So I'll try to finish the 1.1 release and perhaps continue the project.  Not that I'm all that interested in doing CLI frameworks, but I need one for Argo (www.argo.ws).
